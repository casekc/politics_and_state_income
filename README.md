# Economics of Red and Blue States
A analysis of average state income and its relationship to the political affiliation of U.S. senators. The main questions being answered are: what is the average state income of red and blue states? What is the distribution of average state income of red states versus blue states?

Furthermore, the following questions will be answered through the analysis of data on these states:
1) What is the average tax rate of red states vs. blue states
2) Are there differences in industry composition between red and blue states? For instnace, do blue states have more tech workers, while red states have more agricultural workers?
3) What is the average spending on education for red vs. blue states?

As this project develops, I will hope to add more questions and answer more questions through analyzing the data.
